# realm-api-proposal
This is the central collaboration point for HiRez Realm Royale Game API definition.  The goal is to have one stop shopping for all ideas as the API is defined.  

The <b>Endpoints</b> directory is the initial stab at a few key endpoints to get the conversations started.  It is probably not even close to where we'll end up.  Various obvious endpoints aren't even mentioned here such as TestSession, Ping, GetPatchInfo, etc.  We don't even have concept of getGods/Champions() nor getItems() yet.

The <b>Feedback</b> directory contains a template (aaronp.md) I created that can be copied and renamed and your copy can be modified with your feedback.  Your feedback will be visible to others.

The API will evolve, but I want to 80/20 the first out with minimal risk of rework.  Keep in mind that we have limited data available, and that data is only available once a match completes.

The URL prefix for the url is:  <b>http://api.realmroyale.com/realmapi.svc</b>

Thank you all for your cooperation and assistance in this initiative.

Aaron
